# Low-Latency Market Making Bot with ML-Driven Price Prediction

A high-frequency trading system demonstrating professional quantitative development practices, featuring a C++ execution engine integrated with Python machine learning models for algorithmic market making.

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete algorithmic trading system with three core components:

1. **C++ High-Performance Engine** - Low-latency order execution and market data processing
2. **Python ML Pipeline** - Feature engineering and price prediction using ensemble methods
3. **Backtesting Framework** - Historical simulation with comprehensive performance analytics

The system achieves ~70% prediction accuracy on price direction with a Sharpe ratio optimization for market making strategies.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+)
- CMake 3.15+
- Python 3.8+
- Boost libraries (1.70+)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/paradhim/market-making-bot.git
cd market-making-bot
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn lightgbm xgboost matplotlib seaborn joblib ta scipy
```

3. Build C++ components:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
cd ..
```

## Usage

### 1. Generate Market Data

Create realistic synthetic market data with microstructure features:

```bash
python python/data/generate_realistic_data.py
```

This generates:
- `data/raw/trades.csv` - Trade executions with timestamps
- `data/raw/quotes.csv` - Order book snapshots (bid/ask prices and volumes)

### 2. Engineer Features

Calculate comprehensive feature set from raw data:

```bash
python python/ml/feature_engineering.py
```

Output: `data/processed/features_comprehensive.csv` with 100+ features

### 3. Train ML Model

Train ensemble model with walk-forward validation:

```bash
python python/ml/train_model.py
```

Output: `models/ensemble_model.pkl`

### 4. Run Backtest

**Terminal 1** - Start C++ engine:
```bash
./build/main
```

**Terminal 2** - Start signal generator:
```bash
python python/ml/signal_generator_simple.py
```

The system will:
1. Establish IPC handshake
2. Process historical data with ML signals
3. Execute market making strategy
4. Generate `results/backtest_results.csv`

### 5. Analyze Results

Calculate performance metrics:
```bash
python python/analysis/analyze_performance.py
```

Generate visualizations:
```bash
python python/analysis/visualize_results.py
```

Outputs:
- `results/performance_metrics.txt` - Numerical metrics
- `results/equity_curve.png` - Cumulative PnL
- `results/drawdown.png` - Drawdown analysis
- `results/returns_distribution.png` - Return distribution
- `results/performance_dashboard.png` - Comprehensive dashboard

## Configuration

### Strategy Parameters

Edit in `cpp/main.cpp`:

```cpp
StrategyConfig strategy_config;
strategy_config.base_spread_bps = 15.0;    // Base spread in basis points
strategy_config.max_position = 0.5;         // Maximum position size
strategy_config.order_size = 0.01;          // Order quantity
strategy_config.skew_factor = 0.5;          // ML signal influence (0-1)
```

### Model Parameters

Edit in `python/ml/train_model.py`:

```python
# Feature selection
n_features = 100  # Number of features to select

# LightGBM parameters
params = {
    'objective': 'binary',
    'num_leaves': 31,
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'feature_fraction': 0.8,
    'bagging_fraction': 0.8,
    'min_data_in_leaf': 50
}
```

## Technical Details

### IPC Mechanism

The system uses file-based IPC with status monitoring:

1. **Connection Handshake**:
   - C++ writes `CPP_READY` to status file
   - Python waits for C++ readiness
   - Python writes `PYTHON_RUNNING`
   - Both systems confirm connection

2. **Signal Transfer**:
   - Python writes signals to `ipc/ml_signals.txt` (append mode)
   - C++ buffered reader with background thread
   - Content-based deduplication prevents re-reading
   - Non-blocking read with ~5ms polling interval

3. **Graceful Shutdown**:
   - Python writes `PYTHON_SHUTDOWN` when complete
   - C++ processes remaining events (up to 1000 or 2 seconds)
   - C++ writes `CPP_SHUTDOWN`

### Order Book Implementation

```cpp
// Efficient bid/ask tracking
std::map<Price, Quantity, std::greater<Price>> bids_;  // Sorted descending
std::map<Price, Quantity, std::less<Price>> asks_;      // Sorted ascending

// O(1) best price access with caching
std::optional<Price> cached_best_bid_;
std::optional<Price> cached_best_ask_;
```

### Feature Engineering Pipeline

1. **Base Features**: Mid-price, spread, OBI, book depth
2. **Flow Analysis**: Buy/sell volume imbalance across multiple windows
3. **Volatility**: Rolling standard deviation at 10, 20, 50, 100 tick windows
4. **Price Action**: Returns, momentum, Z-scores
5. **Microstructure**: Spread dynamics, thin book detection, price positioning
6. **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD for trend identification

### Model Architecture

**Ensemble Approach**:
- LightGBM: Gradient boosting with leaf-wise growth
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting with depth-wise growth
- Random Forest: Bagging with tree voting

**Prediction**:
```python
y_pred_proba = np.mean([
    model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1] for model in models
], axis=0)
```

## Performance Analysis

### Risk Metrics

The analyzer calculates:
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns (annualized)
- **Sortino Ratio**: Downside risk-adjusted returns
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profit / gross loss ratio

### Visualizations

1. **Equity Curve**: Cumulative PnL over time
2. **Drawdown Chart**: Capital at risk analysis
3. **Returns Distribution**: Histogram with normality test
4. **Rolling Sharpe**: Time-varying risk-adjusted performance
5. **Position Analysis**: Inventory tracking vs PnL
